# Research-Repository

Assesment 3 IT5016D Software Development Fundamentals research repository for Matthew Young 20232058

In this repository I have created 2 separate files.

The My_Projects file includes some of the exercise that I found pivitol for my learning. I wanted to hone my python abilities so i used the whitecliffe exercises to point me in the right direction. Inside each exercise/project is a paragraph explaining what I learned throughout the exercise as well as how I intend to use this technique in future. I have also sourced the questions for all of the answers I have provided

In the InspiringCode folder there is some code that i found online. This is code that is interesting to me and I have added code to parts that I am unfamiliar with. The code in this folder is stuff I find to be slightly above my current level, but for the most part something I could hand code in the near future.
